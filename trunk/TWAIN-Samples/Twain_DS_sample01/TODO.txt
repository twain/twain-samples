===============================

Base class:
 - Create a mechanism for handling multiple dependent capabilities efficiently.
 For example: Compression setting are based on the current selected values for
 Transfer Mechanism, Pixel Type, Bit Depth, and File Format.  The DS should be able
 to remember different settings for each combination.
   
 - Implement compression transfer.

Derived class:
- Implement compression

- Some functions that are implemented in the derived class CTWAINDS_FreeImage
could be migrated to the base class CTWAINDS_Base to be used by all.  Evaluate
functions to determine if migration is possible.


For UI separation / Implementation:
 - Create Windows Form UI
